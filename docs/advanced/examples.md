This page provides practical examples and use cases for the Home Assistant Unraid Integration. These examples demonstrate how to leverage the integration's features in your home automation setup.

## Monitoring Examples

### System Health Dashboard

Create a dedicated dashboard for monitoring your Unraid server's health:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: entities
    title: Unraid System Health
    entities:
      - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_cpu_usage
      - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_memory_usage
      - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_cpu_temperature
      - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_uptime

  - type: horizontal-stack
    cards:
      - type: gauge
        name: CPU Usage
        entity: sensor.unraid_tower_cpu_usage
        min: 0
        max: 100
        severity:
          green: 0
          yellow: 50
          red: 80

      - type: gauge
        name: Memory Usage
        entity: sensor.unraid_tower_memory_usage
        min: 0
        max: 100
        severity:
          green: 0
          yellow: 70
          red: 90
```

### Disk Health Monitoring

Monitor the health of your array disks:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Unraid Disk Health
entities:
  - entity: binary_sensor.unraid_tower_array_status
  - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_array_usage
  - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_array_protection
  - type: divider
  - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_disk_disk1_temperature
  - entity: binary_sensor.unraid_tower_disk_disk1_smart_status
  - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_disk_disk1_usage
  - type: divider
  - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_disk_disk2_temperature
  - entity: binary_sensor.unraid_tower_disk_disk2_smart_status
  - entity: sensor.unraid_tower_disk_disk2_usage
