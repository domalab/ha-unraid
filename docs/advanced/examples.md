        data:
          entry_id: !input unraid_entry_id
          command: "/usr/local/bin/container_prioritizer.sh"
```

## Using These Examples

To use these examples in your Home Assistant instance:

1. Replace `!input unraid_entry_id` with your actual Unraid integration entry ID
2. Adjust entity IDs to match your specific entities
3. Modify conditions and triggers to suit your schedule and preferences
4. Test the automations thoroughly before relying on them

For more information on finding your entry ID, see the [Troubleshooting](../user-guide/troubleshooting.md#finding-your-entry-id) page.
