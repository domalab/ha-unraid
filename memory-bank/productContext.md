# Product Context: Unraid Integration for Home Assistant

## Problem Statement
Home Assistant users with Unraid servers currently lack a seamless way to monitor and control their servers within their home automation environment. They need to switch between interfaces, which creates a disconnected experience and prevents integrated automations.

## Solution
The Unraid Integration for Home Assistant bridges this gap by providing a comprehensive integration that brings Unraid monitoring and control capabilities directly into the Home Assistant ecosystem.

## Key User Problems Addressed

### Problem 1: Disconnected Monitoring
Users previously had to access their Unraid dashboard separately from their Home Assistant interface to check server stats.

**Solution:** Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, disk usage, temperatures, and other vital stats directly within Home Assistant.

### Problem 2: Manual Intervention for Container/VM Management
Users needed to log into their Unraid admin panel to start/stop Docker containers and VMs.

**Solution:** Full control of Docker containers and VMs through Home Assistant entities, allowing for automation based on schedules or triggers.

### Problem 3: Limited Automation Capabilities
No way to trigger Unraid actions based on Home Assistant events or incorporate Unraid status into automation rules.

**Solution:** Comprehensive service calls and entities that enable complex automation scenarios involving Unraid resources.

### Problem 4: Lack of Integrated Diagnostics
Difficult to proactively identify and resolve Unraid server issues.

**Solution:** Advanced diagnostics and automatic repair flows for common issues, with integration into Home Assistant's notification system.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Easy setup process with clear configuration steps
2. **Reliability**: Stable connection with graceful error handling
3. **Comprehensive**: Cover all major Unraid management needs
4. **Responsive**: Quick updates of sensor values with configurable polling intervals
5. **Informative**: Clear documentation and helpful error messages
6. **Extensible**: Ability to execute custom scripts and commands for advanced users

## Impact

This integration transforms how users interact with their Unraid servers by:

1. Creating a unified smart home dashboard that includes server monitoring
2. Enabling powerful automations that incorporate server status and control
3. Reducing the need to switch between interfaces
4. Providing early warning for potential server issues
5. Allowing for more sophisticated home automation scenarios that include server resources
